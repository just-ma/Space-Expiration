# Space Expiration
Space Expiration is a mobile bluetooth multiplayer game completed as a quarter-long project for a networks design class. I led a group of four, teaching members the basics of Unity as well as how to structure scripts efficiently.

I coded the enemy boss AI, which pursued the closest ship and adjusted its speed so players could not outrun it forever. I had asteroids and resources spawn close but outside the camera view. As a designer, I helped create animations and UI elements.
